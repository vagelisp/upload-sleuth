# UploadSleuth – Media Audit & Cleanup

UploadSleuth is a cautious WordPress uploads auditor. It inventories files on disk, removes known Media Library files and their generated variants from consideration, searches WordPress database content for textual references, and presents the remainder as **likely stray candidates**.

It is designed for administrators and developers who need evidence before cleaning an old or bloated `wp-content/uploads` directory.

> A missing reference is not proof that a file is unused. Back up the site, review every result, run a dry run, and prefer quarantine over permanent deletion.

## Highlights

- AJAX admin workflow under **Tools → UploadSleuth**—no page reload during scans or file actions.
- Batched dashboard scans with live progress, cancellation, and saved partial findings.
- Separate Media Library integrity checks for missing local originals and generated sizes.
- Result summary with scanned files, attachment matches, database matches, candidate count, and potential disk space.
- Persistent cleanup statistics for reclaimed space, permanent removals, quarantine moves, and restores.
- Search, sort, bulk selection, dry-run, quarantine, verified backup-and-remove, and guarded permanent deletion.
- Per-user results retained for 12 hours.
- Attachment-aware matching for originals, generated sizes, edited originals, and backup sizes.
- Reference checks across posts, excerpts, GUIDs, post meta, options, term meta, user meta, and comment meta.
- Optional custom-table detection and broad non-core table scanning.
- WP-CLI output in table, CSV, JSON, or YAML format.
- Complete in-dashboard CLI reference with copy-ready recipes.
- CLI filters for candidate age and size, CI exit behavior, and explicit deletion confirmation.
- Local-only operation. The plugin does not call an external service.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or newer
- PHP 7.4 or newer
- WP-CLI for command-line usage
- An administrator account for the dashboard

## Installation

1. Copy the plugin directory to `wp-content/plugins/upload-sleuth`.
2. Activate **UploadSleuth** in WordPress.
3. Open **Tools → UploadSleuth**.
4. Save any ignore or custom-table settings before the first broad scan.

## Recommended workflow

1. Make a verified filesystem and database backup.
2. Scan a narrow uploads subdirectory such as `2026/08`.
3. Keep database checking enabled for the most conservative result.
4. Filter and inspect the candidates.
5. Select a small batch and run a dry-run quarantine.
6. Disable dry-run and quarantine the files.
7. Test the public site and administrative workflows.
8. Restore any file that proves necessary, or remove old quarantine runs manually after an appropriate retention period.

The plugin deliberately labels results as candidates. References can live in encoded values, files, remote services, custom database schemas, or runtime-generated code that a textual database search cannot discover.

## Dashboard

### Scan options

- **Uploads subdirectory:** Restricts inventory to a path relative to the uploads root.
- **Database check limit:** Stops database checks after a fixed number of candidates. `0` means unlimited. A limited scan is incomplete and is marked as such.
- **Include non-media files:** Reports extensions not registered in the WordPress MIME map. Quarantine, restore, backup, and deletion still reject them.
- **Fast scan:** Skips database text searches. This is faster but produces lower-confidence candidates.

Dashboard reference checks use a configurable batch size of 25 by default. **Stop scan** preserves findings through the latest completed batch and marks them as partial. Partial results never imply that the remaining candidates are clean; they simply have not been classified yet. Saved partial rows can still be reviewed or used with dry-run and quarantine. Last-moment reference validation remains enabled by default and can be disabled in advanced settings when an administrator explicitly accepts the additional risk.

### Slow-server tuning

- **Scan batch size:** Candidates checked per scan request; reduce it when scan steps time out.
- **File-action batch size:** Files deleted or quarantined per request; smaller batches provide more frequent progress updates.
- **Pause between batches:** Adds breathing room between action requests on constrained servers.
- **Rows rendered per view:** Limits findings and action-report DOM nodes while keeping the complete data available through Load more.
- **Revalidate references:** Recommended and enabled by default. Disabling it skips the expensive current-reference lookup but retains capability, nonce, saved-finding, and path-safety checks.

### Settings

- **Ignore patterns:** One glob per line. Examples: `cache/*`, `tmp/`, or `*.webp`.
- **Custom table checks:** Comma-separated `table:column` pairs. The current WordPress prefix can be omitted.
- **Scan all non-core tables:** Detects and searches text-like columns in other tables. This can be expensive.
- **Quarantine directory:** Stored below the dedicated `uploads/upload-sleuth` directory and automatically excluded from future audits.

### File actions

- **Dry run:** Opt-in preview that reports the planned action without touching files.
- **Quarantine:** Moves files into a timestamped directory while preserving relative paths.
- **Restore:** Lists quarantined files in the dashboard and moves a selected file back to its original uploads path. An existing destination is never overwritten.
- **Quarantine deletion:** Permanently deletes selected recoverable quarantine entries or all recoverable entries; backup ZIPs are excluded.
- **Download ZIP & remove (dashboard):** Builds one ZIP, reads every archived entry back to verify its byte count and SHA-256 hash, and only then removes the originals and starts the download.
- **Backup & remove (WP-CLI):** Builds one ZIP below the protected UploadSleuth storage directory, verifies every entry by size and SHA-256, and only then removes the originals.
- **Delete:** Permanently unlinks selected findings or the entire saved finding set and cannot be undone. The UI requires confirmation when dry-run is disabled.

Every submitted path is checked against the current user's saved findings and normalized as a safe relative uploads path before an action is attempted. Filesystem actions are restricted to file types recognised by WordPress, symbolic links are rejected, and quarantined files receive a non-executable storage suffix.

### Media Library integrity

The **Library integrity** tab audits the other side of the uploads relationship: attachment database records whose expected local original no longer exists. It also reports attachment metadata that names generated image sizes missing from disk while the original remains available.

The check runs in configurable batches, shows real completed/total progress, and can be stopped after the current request. Completed findings remain available. Missing generated sizes are report-only and can usually be addressed with a thumbnail-regeneration tool after the source image is verified.

Only missing-original records can be selected for cleanup. Immediately before deletion, the server confirms that the attachment came from the saved integrity result and that its local original is still absent. It then calls `wp_delete_attachment($id, true)` so WordPress removes the post, attachment metadata, relationships, known remaining generated files, and runs normal attachment-deletion hooks.

WordPress can delete the database record even if an individual companion file cannot be removed. UploadSleuth compares known local companions before and after the call, flags any survivors in the per-record outcome, and counts only files that actually disappeared as reclaimed storage.

> Object-storage and media-offload plugins may intentionally remove local files while retaining valid remote media. The integrity screen cannot prove a remote object is absent. Review those records with the offload provider before deleting anything; both the screen and confirmations call out this risk.

## WP-CLI

The command is:

```bash
wp upload-sleuth
```

### Useful examples

```bash
# Audit all registered media files.
wp upload-sleuth

# Audit one year and return machine-readable results.
wp upload-sleuth --uploads-subdir=2025 --format=json

# Only show candidates at least 100 KB and older than 90 days.
wp upload-sleuth --min-size=100 --older-than=90

# Print counts and space without listing every file.
wp upload-sleuth --summary-only

# Preview quarantine operations.
wp upload-sleuth --quarantine --dry-run

# Move all findings into quarantine.
wp upload-sleuth --quarantine

# Preview a verified backup-and-remove run, then explicitly confirm it.
wp upload-sleuth --backup-delete --dry-run
wp upload-sleuth --backup-delete --yes

# Preview permanent deletion, then explicitly confirm it.
wp upload-sleuth --delete --dry-run
wp upload-sleuth --delete --yes

# Save a resumable checkpoint for long scans.
wp upload-sleuth --state-file=/path/upload-sleuth-scan.json

# Resume an interrupted scan, or clear its checkpoint.
wp upload-sleuth --resume --state-file=/path/upload-sleuth-scan.json
wp upload-sleuth --clear-state --state-file=/path/upload-sleuth-scan.json

# Fail a CI or maintenance job when candidates exist.
wp upload-sleuth --summary-only --fail-on-findings

# Save a JSON report for review in the dashboard.
wp upload-sleuth --save-report=/path/upload-sleuth-report.json

### Options

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--uploads-subdir=<path>` | Restrict the scan below uploads. |
| `--limit=<number>` | Limit database-checked candidates; `0` is unlimited. |
| `--min-size=<kb>` | Only report candidates at least this large. |
| `--older-than=<days>` | Only report candidates older than this age. |
| `--all-files` | Report non-media extensions; filesystem actions still reject them. |
| `--skip-db-check` | Use attachment metadata only. |
| `--ignore=<patterns>` | Add comma-separated glob patterns. |
| `--ignore-file=<path>` | Read newline-separated patterns, with `#` comments. |
| `--custom-tables=<list>` | Add `table:column` reference checks. |
| `--scan-all-tables` | Search text columns in non-core tables. |
| `--format=<format>` | Use `table`, `csv`, `json`, or `yaml`. |
| `--summary-only` | Suppress individual finding rows. |
| `--quarantine` | Move findings to quarantine. |
| `--backup-delete` | Create verified backups, then remove originals. |
| `--delete` | Permanently remove findings. |
| `--dry-run` | Simulate the chosen file action. |
| `--yes` | Required for a real `--delete`. |
| `--quarantine-dir=<path>` | Override the quarantine directory. |
| `--progress` | Show an animated progress bar for interactive table scans. |
| `--state-file=<path>` | Save resumable scan checkpoints as JSON. |
| `--resume` | Resume from the checkpoint supplied by `--state-file`. |
| `--clear-state` | Remove a saved scan checkpoint. |
| `--save-report=<path>` | Save the complete findings payload as JSON for dashboard import. |
| `--fail-on-findings` | Exit non-zero when candidates exist. |

`--quarantine`, `--backup-delete`, and `--delete` are mutually exclusive. Real backup-and-remove and permanent-delete operations require `--yes`.

## Scan diagnostics

Enable **Browser console diagnostics** in Settings, then open the browser developer console before starting a dashboard scan to see submitted options, a heartbeat every five seconds, errors, elapsed request time, and a final result summary. File-action samples are capped at 100 rows. Diagnostics are disabled by default, and their heartbeat timer and large payload construction do not run while disabled.

WP-CLI reports when filesystem inventory and attachment indexing complete, then prints a milestone for every 250 database candidates checked. Interactive table scans also show a progress bar; use `--state-file` to checkpoint long scans and `--resume` after an interruption. JSON reports created with `--save-report` can be imported from the WP-CLI tab for read-only dashboard review. These messages make long scans observable without changing machine-readable finding rows.

## Integration hooks

UploadSleuth exposes lifecycle actions for notification and automation integrations:

- `upload_sleuth_scan_started( $context, $source )`
- `upload_sleuth_scan_completed( $findings, $source )`
- `upload_sleuth_scan_stopped( $findings, $source )`
- `upload_sleuth_action_started( $context )`
- `upload_sleuth_action_completed( $context )`
- `upload_sleuth_delete_started` / `upload_sleuth_delete_completed`
- `upload_sleuth_quarantine_started` / `upload_sleuth_quarantine_completed`
- `upload_sleuth_backup_delete_started` / `upload_sleuth_backup_delete_completed`
- `upload_sleuth_quarantine_emptied( $context )`

The source argument is `dashboard` or `cli`. File-level hooks use the same `upload_sleuth_*` namespace. The dashboard also links to [Notificator – Alerts & Notifications](https://wordpress.org/plugins/notificator-project/) for optional alerts.

## What is checked

UploadSleuth builds an attachment reference index from `_wp_attached_file` and `_wp_attachment_metadata`. It recognizes the main file, generated image sizes, `original_image`, and `backup_sizes`.

For files not in that index, it searches common textual storage locations:

- `posts.post_content`, `posts.post_excerpt`, and `posts.guid`
- post, term, user, and comment metadata
- WordPress options
- explicitly configured custom table columns
- optionally detected text, character, and JSON columns in non-core tables

URL-encoded URLs, plain URLs, `/uploads/` fragments, and relative paths are considered.

## Known limitations

- Initial filesystem inventory and attachment indexing occur in the first request; exceptionally large libraries can still make that preparation request expensive. Database candidate checks are batched and stoppable.
- Binary, encrypted, compressed, or unusually encoded references may not match.
- External databases, object storage, APIs, CSS/JavaScript/PHP files, and remote content are outside the default search.
- The integrity check tests the local filesystem only, so intentionally offloaded media can appear as missing and must be verified with its remote provider.
- A database-check limit makes the result incomplete.
- The restore browser lists up to 500 quarantined files at a time; backup ZIPs are intentionally excluded.
- Files removed directly from disk do not trigger WordPress attachment lifecycle hooks.

## Security model

- Dashboard access requires `manage_options`.
- AJAX requests require a user nonce.
- Settings and submitted paths are sanitized.
- File actions only accept paths present in the current user's saved audit.
- Attachment metadata and database references are rechecked immediately before every action.
- Files that became referenced after scanning are blocked and left untouched.
- Traversal-like or control-character paths are rejected.
- Standalone files are removed through WordPress `wp_delete_file()` and its filter.
- Registered attachments are never removed as raw files. Integrity cleanup accepts only saved missing-original records, rechecks the original, and uses `wp_delete_attachment()`.
- Real CLI deletion requires `--yes`.

## Extending reference detection

Implementation boundaries, scan-job fields, cancellation semantics, and filesystem safety invariants are documented in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

Ignore patterns can be modified with the `upload_sleuth_ignore_patterns` filter:

```php
add_filter('upload_sleuth_ignore_patterns', function ($patterns) {
    $patterns[] = 'generated-reports/*';
    return $patterns;
});
```

File-action integrations can observe these hooks:

- `upload_sleuth_before_file_action` — before a real quarantine, backup removal, or deletion.
- `upload_sleuth_file_quarantined` — after a file is moved successfully.
- `upload_sleuth_file_restored` — after a quarantined file is restored successfully.
- `upload_sleuth_quarantined_file_deleted` — after a quarantined file is permanently removed.
- `upload_sleuth_file_backed_up_and_removed` — after a verified backup and successful original removal.
- `upload_sleuth_file_deleted` — after WordPress successfully removes a standalone file.

Core `wp_delete_file` filtering also applies to backup removal and permanent deletion.

## Creating a release

The **Create release** GitHub Actions workflow performs the complete release process manually and safely:

1. Update the version in the `upload-sleuth.php` plugin header, `UPLOAD_SLEUTH_VERSION`, and the `readme.txt` stable tag.
2. Add the matching changelog entries and a user-facing `.github/release-notes/X.Y.Z.md` file, then merge the changes into the default branch.
3. Open **Actions → Create release → Run workflow**.
4. Choose whether the release is a prerelease and run it from the commit you want to publish.

The workflow refuses mismatched versions, missing release notes, and existing tags. It creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag, packages a clean `upload-sleuth` plugin directory, verifies the ZIP, generates a SHA-256 checksum, and publishes both files with the curated release notes in a GitHub Release.

The repository also includes a WordPress Playground Blueprint at `.wordpress-org/blueprints/blueprint.json`. After the plugin is approved and its WordPress.org SVN repository is available, run **Actions → Sync WordPress.org Playground Blueprint** with a dry run first, then run it again with dry run disabled. Store the SVN credentials as the `SVN_USERNAME` and `SVN_PASSWORD` secrets in the `wordpress-org` environment. The release package excludes `.wordpress-org` because these assets belong in the WordPress.org SVN `assets` directory, not in the plugin ZIP.

### Deploying to WordPress.org SVN

The **Deploy UploadSleuth to WordPress.org** workflow synchronizes the committed plugin source to `trunk`, publishes the directory icon and banners from `.wordpress-org/assets/`, and creates a matching version tag under `tags/`. It uses the approved repository at `https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/upload-sleuth`.

Create a GitHub environment named `wordpress-org` with `SVN_USERNAME` and `SVN_PASSWORD` secrets. Run the workflow with its default dry run first and inspect the SVN diff. Run it again with dry run disabled only after the diff is correct. The workflow derives the version from `upload-sleuth.php` and `readme.txt`, so update both before each deployment.
