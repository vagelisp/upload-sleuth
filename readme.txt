Find files that may be unused in WordPress uploads, spot missing Media Library files, and safely review, quarantine, back up, or delete them.

== Description ==

UploadSleuth reconciles files in the uploads directory against WordPress attachment metadata and database references.

Files without a detected reference are shown as likely stray candidates. They are not declared safe to delete. The plugin encourages a review, dry-run, and quarantine workflow before permanent removal.

= Features =

* AJAX-powered dashboard under Tools > UploadSleuth.
* Scan summaries including candidate count and potential disk space.
* Persistent storage-impact statistics for reclaimed space and completed cleanup actions.
* Search, sorting, bulk selection, and per-user saved results.
* Dry-run, timestamped quarantine, verified backup-and-remove, and guarded deletion.
* Recognition of attachment originals, generated sizes, edited originals, and backups.
* Checks for references in posts, metadata, options, and configured custom tables.
* Optional non-core database table scanning.
* WP-CLI table, CSV, JSON, and YAML output.
* CLI age and size filters, CI mode, and explicit permanent-delete confirmation.
* Complete in-dashboard WP-CLI reference with copy-ready recipes.
* Optional last-moment attachment and database revalidation, enabled by default.
* Configurable scan/action batches and pauses for slow servers.
* WordPress-native standalone-file deletion through `wp_delete_file()`.
* Stoppable batched scans that preserve reviewed partial findings.
* Separate Media Library integrity checks for missing originals and generated image sizes.
* WordPress-native cleanup of reviewed missing-file attachment records.
* No external service or telemetry.

= Important safety note =

A file can be referenced by an external system, theme or plugin code, encoded data, a custom database, or another location the plugin cannot inspect. Make a verified backup and test quarantined files before deleting anything permanently.

UploadSleuth is maintained by the same developer behind [Notificator – Alerts & Notifications](https://wordpress.org/plugins/notificator/), a WordPress plugin for turning site events into dashboard alerts and optional mobile or MQTT notifications. [Browse the UploadSleuth source code on GitHub](https://github.com/vagelisp/upload-sleuth).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `upload-sleuth` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate UploadSleuth through the Plugins screen.
3. Open Tools > UploadSleuth.
4. Configure ignore patterns or custom table checks if needed.
5. Begin with a narrow subdirectory scan.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does a finding mean the file is safe to delete? =

No. A finding means the plugin did not detect a reference in the locations it checked. Treat it as a candidate requiring review.

= What does quarantine do? =

Quarantine moves selected files into a timestamped directory below the configured quarantine folder while preserving their original relative paths. The quarantine directory is excluded from future scans.

= Can I restore a quarantined file? =

Yes. The Quarantined files panel lists recoverable files and restores each one to its original uploads path. Restore is blocked rather than overwriting a file that already exists there.

The same panel can permanently delete selected quarantined files or all recoverable quarantined files. Downloadable backup ZIPs are not included in Delete all.

= What does Download ZIP & remove do? =

The dashboard and WP-CLI create one ZIP, verify every archived entry using its size and SHA-256 hash, and only then remove the originals. The dashboard starts an authenticated download; WP-CLI reports the protected server-side archive path.

= Can I preview an action? =

Yes. Dry-run is an opt-in checkbox in the dashboard. WP-CLI supports `--dry-run` with quarantine or deletion.

= Can I stop a long scan? =

Yes. Dashboard scans process database candidates in small batches. Stop finishes the current request, saves everything classified through the latest completed batch, and marks the result as partial. Unprocessed candidates are not included in partial findings.

= Does it support ACF? =

ACF commonly stores values in post, term, user, and options metadata. Those locations are checked. Unusual custom tables can be configured explicitly.

= What is the WP-CLI command? =

Run `wp upload-sleuth`. Use `wp help upload-sleuth` for all options.

= How do I inspect older, larger candidates only? =

Use `wp upload-sleuth --older-than=90 --min-size=100` to report candidates older than 90 days and at least 100 KB.

= Can the command be used in automation? =

Yes. `--summary-only --fail-on-findings` provides a concise result and a non-zero exit when candidates exist.

= Does the plugin send data elsewhere? =

No. Scanning and file operations run locally within WordPress.

= Can it find Media Library records whose files are missing? =

Yes. The Library integrity tab checks attachment records in batches. It reports missing local originals and, separately, generated sizes that are absent while the original exists. Missing-original records can be deleted individually or all at once after confirmation; cleanup uses WordPress `wp_delete_attachment()` rather than direct database queries.

Sites using S3, CDN, or another media-offload plugin require special care. A valid remote attachment may intentionally have no local file, so confirm the remote object and offload configuration before deleting a reported record.

== WP-CLI Examples ==

`wp upload-sleuth`

`wp upload-sleuth --uploads-subdir=2025 --format=json`

`wp upload-sleuth --older-than=90 --min-size=100 --summary-only`

`wp upload-sleuth --quarantine --dry-run`

`wp upload-sleuth --delete --dry-run`

`wp upload-sleuth --backup-delete --dry-run`

Real permanent deletion requires `wp upload-sleuth --delete --yes`. A real backup-and-remove operation similarly requires `wp upload-sleuth --backup-delete --yes`.
